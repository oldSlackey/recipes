# Lamb breast, spinach and feta
Ask your butcher for breasts of lamb with the bones removed.
It will speed up the process and save you an unnecessary half-hour
of home butchery. When you add the cooked and drained peas to
the roasting tin, turn them over in the pan juices from the roast – it will add much savour.

Serves 8-10

**Ingredients**  
_spinach 300g  
mint leaves 15  
spring onions 6  
olive oil 2 tbsp, plus a little more  
feta 200g  
lamb breasts 2, bones removed, approximately 1 kg each   
peas 300g (podded weight)_

**Method**  
Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove the stalks from the spinach
and wash the leaves thoroughly under cold running water.
The leaves still wet, pile them into a deep pan over a
moderate heat then cover tightly with a lid. Let the leaves
cook for 2 or 3 minutes in their own steam, shaking the pan so
they soften evenly. As soon as they are bright green and wilted,
remove from the heat and plunge into iced water. Squeeze the
leaves to remove the water, then chop them roughly and set them aside in a bowl.

Roughly chop the mint leaves, then add them to the spinach, together with a generous seasoning of black pepper.

Roughly chop the spring onions, then let them soften in the olive oil in a shallow pan over a medium heat. Add the spring onions to the spinach, crumble in the feta cheese in small lumps, then mix lightly.

Lay the breasts of lamb flat on a work surface and spread the spinach filling over them, leaving a small rim of meat around the edges, then roll them up and secure with butcher’s string. Place the rolled breasts in a roasting tin, rub them lightly with olive oil and crumbled sea salt, then roast them for one hour. Remove them from the oven and leave them to rest, covered with foil.

Cook the peas in boiling, lightly salted water for a few minutes until tender, then drain them and tip them into the tin around the lamb. Carve the lamb into thick slices and serve.
